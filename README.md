# Code and Supplementary Material for Towards Differential Privacy for Many Explainers

This is the repository for the code and supplementary material for the paper "Towards Differential Privacy for Many Explainers".
# Code

The list of required python packages can be found in `requirements.txt`. You can test an explainer by calling `demo_one_feature()` or `demo_all_features()` in the respective python file for the plot explainers, or by executing `pfi_explainer.py` for the rank aggregation explainers. You can run the experiments by executing `ale_pdp_evaluation.py` or `pfi_evaluation.py`.

# Supplementary Material

The supplementary material -- with additional results, all proofs, and the design and evaluation of Partial Dependence Plots -- can be found as a PDF file `Supplementary_Material_Towards_Differential_Privacy_for_Many_Explainers.pdf` in the root folder.
